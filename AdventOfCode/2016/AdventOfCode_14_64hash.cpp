  Description:  In order to communicate securely with Santa while you're on this
                mission, you've been using a one-time pad that you generate
                using a pre-agreed algorithm. Unfortunately, you've run out of
                keys in your one-time pad, and so you need to generate some
                more.

                To generate keys, you first get a stream of random data by
                taking the MD5 of a pre-arranged salt (your puzzle input) and an
                increasing integer index (starting with 0, and represented in
                decimal); the resulting MD5 hash should be represented as a
                string of lowercase hexadecimal digits.

                However, not all of these MD5 hashes are keys, and you need 64
                new keys for your one-time pad. A hash is a key only if:

                It contains three of the same character in a row, like 777. Only
                consider the first such triplet in a hash.
                One of the next 1000 hashes in the stream contains that same
                character five times in a row, like 77777.
                Considering future hashes for five-of-a-kind sequences does not
                cause those hashes to be skipped; instead, regardless of whether
                the current hash is a key, always resume testing for keys
                starting with the very next hash.

                For example, if the pre-arranged salt is abc:

                - The first index which produces a triple is 18, because the MD5
                hash of abc18 contains ...cc38887a5.... However, index 18 does
                not count as a key for your one-time pad, because none of the
                next thousand hashes (index 19 through index 1018) contain
                88888.
                - The next index which produces a triple is 39; the hash of
                abc39 contains eee. It is also the first key: one of the next
                thousand hashes (the one at index 816) contains eeeee.
                - None of the next six triples are keys, but the one after that,
                at index 92, is: it contains 999 and index 200 contains 99999.
                - Eventually, index 22728 meets all of the criteria to generate
                the 64th key.
                
                So, using our example salt of abc, index 22728 produces the 64th
                key.

                Given the actual salt in your puzzle input, what index produces
                your 64th one-time pad key?

                --- Part Two ---

                Of course, in order to make this process even more secure,
                you've also implemented key stretching.

                Key stretching forces attackers to spend more time generating
                hashes. Unfortunately, it forces everyone else to spend more
                time, too.

                To implement key stretching, whenever you generate a hash,
                before you use it, you first find the MD5 hash of that hash,
                then the MD5 hash of that hash, and so on, a total of 2016
                additional hashings. Always use lowercase hexadecimal
                representations of hashes.

                For example, to find the stretched hash for index 0 and salt
                abc:

                - Find the MD5 hash of abc0: 577571be4de9dcce85a041ba0410f29f.
                - Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash: 
                eec80a0c92dc8a0777c619d9bb51e910.
                - Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash: 
                16062ce768787384c81fe17a7a60c7e3.
                ...repeat many times...
                - Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash: 
                a107ff634856bb300138cac6568c0f24.
                
                So, the stretched hash for index 0 in this situation is 
                a107ff.... In the end, you find the original hash (one use of
                MD5), then find the hash-of-the-previous-hash 2016 times, for a
                total of 2017 uses of MD5.

                The rest of the process remains the same, but now the keys are
                entirely different. Again for salt abc:

                - The first triple (222, at index 5) has no matching 22222 in
                the next thousand hashes.
                - The second triple (eee, at index 10) hash a matching eeeee at
                index 89, and so it is the first key.
                - Eventually, index 22551 produces the 64th key (triple fff with
                matching fffff at index 22859.

                Given the actual salt in your puzzle input and using 2016 extra
                MD5 calls of key stretching, what index now produces your 64th
                one-time pad key?
