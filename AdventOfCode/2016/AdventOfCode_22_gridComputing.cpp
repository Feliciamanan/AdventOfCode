/*
 Description:   You gain access to a massive storage cluster arranged in a grid;
                each storage node is only connected to the four nodes directly
                adjacent to it (three if the node is on an edge, two if it's in
                a corner).

                You can directly access data only on node /dev/grid/node-x0-y0,
                but you can perform some limited actions on the other nodes:

                You can get the disk usage of all nodes (via df). The result of
                doing this is in your puzzle input.
                You can instruct a node to move (not copy) all of its data to an
                adjacent node (if the destination node has enough space to
                receive the data). The sending node is left empty after this
                operation.
                Nodes are named by their position: the node named node-x10-y10 
                is adjacent to nodes node-x9-y10, node-x11-y10, node-x10-y9, and
                node-x10-y11.

                Before you begin, you need to understand the arrangement of data
                on these nodes. Even though you can only move data between
                directly connected nodes, you're going to need to rearrange a
                lot of the data to get access to the data you need. Therefore,
                you need to work out how you might be able to shift data around.

                To do this, you'd like to count the number of viable pairs of
                nodes. A viable pair is any two nodes (A,B), regardless of
                whether they are directly connected, such that:

                - Node A is not empty (its Used is not zero).
                - Nodes A and B are not the same node.
                - The data on node A (its Used) would fit on node B (its Avail).
                
                How many viable pairs of nodes are there?

                Now that you have a better understanding of the grid, it's time
                to get to work.

                Your goal is to gain access to the data which begins in the node
                with y=0 and the highest x (that is, the node in the top-right
                corner).

                For example, suppose you have the following grid:

                Filesystem            Size  Used  Avail  Use%
                /dev/grid/node-x0-y0   10T    8T     2T   80%
                /dev/grid/node-x0-y1   11T    6T     5T   54%
                /dev/grid/node-x0-y2   32T   28T     4T   87%
                /dev/grid/node-x1-y0    9T    7T     2T   77%
                /dev/grid/node-x1-y1    8T    0T     8T    0%
                /dev/grid/node-x1-y2   11T    7T     4T   63%
                /dev/grid/node-x2-y0   10T    6T     4T   60%
                /dev/grid/node-x2-y1    9T    8T     1T   88%
                /dev/grid/node-x2-y2    9T    6T     3T   66%

                In this example, you have a storage grid 3 nodes wide and 3
                nodes tall. The node you can access directly, node-x0-y0, is
                almost full. The node containing the data you want to access,
                node-x2-y0 (because it has y=0 and the highest x value),
                contains 6 terabytes of data - enough to fit on your node, if
                only you could make enough space to move it there.

                Fortunately, node-x1-y1 looks like it has enough free space to
                enable you to move some of this data around. In fact, it seems
                like all of the nodes have enough space to hold any node's data
                (except node-x0-y2, which is much larger, very full, and not 
                moving any time soon). So, initially, the grid's capacities and
                connections look like this:

                ( 8T/10T) --  7T/ 9T -- [ 6T/10T]
                    |           |           |
                  6T/11T  --  0T/ 8T --   8T/ 9T
                    |           |           |
                 28T/32T  --  7T/11T --   6T/ 9T
                The node you can access directly is in parentheses; the data you
                want starts in the node marked by square brackets.

                In this example, most of the nodes are interchangable: they're
                full enough that no other node's data would fit, but small
                enough that their data could be moved around. Let's draw these
                nodes as .. The exceptions are the empty node, which we'll draw
                as _, and the very large, very full node, which we'll draw as #.
                Let's also draw the goal data as G. Then, it looks like this:

                (.) .  G
                 .  _  .
                 #  .  .

                The goal is to move the data in the top right, G, to the node in
                parentheses. To do this, we can issue some commands to the grid
                and rearrange the data:

                - Move data from node-y0-x1 to node-y1-x1, leaving node
                node-y0-x1 empty:

                (.) _  G
                 .  .  .
                 #  .  .

                - Move the goal data from node-y0-x2 to node-y0-x1:

                (.) G  _
                 .  .  .
                 #  .  .

                - At this point, we're quite close. However, we have no deletion
                command, so we have to move some more data around. So, next, we
                move the data from node-y1-x2 to node-y0-x2:

                (.) G  .
                 .  .  _
                 #  .  .

                - Move the data from node-y1-x1 to node-y1-x2:

                (.) G  .
                 .  _  .
                 #  .  .

                - Move the data from node-y1-x0 to node-y1-x1:

                (.) G  .
                 _  .  .
                 #  .  .

                - Next, we can free up space on our node by moving the data from
                node-y0-x0 to node-y1-x0:

                (_) G  .
                 .  .  .
                 #  .  .

                - Finally, we can access the goal data by moving the it from
                node-y0-x1 to node-y0-x0:

                (G) _  .
                 .  .  .
                 #  .  .

                So, after 7 steps, we've accessed the data we want.
                Unfortunately, each of these moves takes time, and we need to be
                efficient:

                What is the fewest number of steps required to move your goal
                data to node-x0-y0?

                Your puzzle answer was 233.
