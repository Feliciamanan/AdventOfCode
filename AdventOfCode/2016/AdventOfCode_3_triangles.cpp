 Description:   Now that you can think clearly, you move deeper into the
                labyrinth of hallways and office furniture that makes up this
                part of Easter Bunny HQ. This must be a graphic design
                department; the walls are covered in specifications for
                triangles. Or are they?
 
                The design document gives the side lengths of each triangle it
                describes, but... 5 10 25? Some of these aren't triangles. You
                can't help but mark the impossible ones.
 
                In a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be larger
                than the remaining side. For example, the "triangle" given above
                is impossible, because 5 + 10 is not larger than 25.
                 
                In your puzzle input, how many of the listed triangles are
                possible?
